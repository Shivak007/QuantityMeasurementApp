# Quantity Measurement App

### Overview

The Quantity Measurement App is a full-stack application designed to compare, convert, and perform arithmetic operations on different measurable quantities such as length and weight.

The application is developed incrementally using well-defined use cases to ensure scope discipline, maintainability, and high code quality.

### Objectives

- Compare two quantities for equality

- Support multiple units within a quantity type

- Enable unit conversion

- Perform quantity arithmetic

- Ensure mathematical correctness and robustness

- Maintain 100% unit test coverage
